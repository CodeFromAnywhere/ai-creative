This is a plugin!


TODO:

- Make it possible to send out a template to the masses, preferably with a personal followup message and possibly some free messages. Ensure it's possible to filter on country as well to save money.

MAKE IT MP4 WITH SUBTITLES

- continue song until the end after rap is done
- check length of audio
- whisper audio to get srt
- create video with single image of the artist for the duration of the song (pick a AI generated art image)
- add the audio to the video
- add hard subtitles to the video (see https://www.bannerbear.com/blog/how-to-add-subtitles-to-a-video-file-using-ffmpeg/)
- don't output the lyrics anymore, just the video is enough
- store the video in the persons memory

  # translateLyrics()

If I make this and I can find a way to do this for under a cent per song, we can integrate with spotify playtlists (our youtube playlists, even easier) in order to create a way for people to much more easily learn a language through music.

Once AI improves further, we might be able to use voice to voice, and input the original lyrics + the translated variant, to output a translated version that flows the same... This would be truly amazing.

NB: Many of these steps are useful by themselves as plugins to, for example, open-ai.
