<!--
Holy shit, I've set the basis in just 2 hours. Let's spend an actual couple of weeks on this and see how good it can get. If I trust my gut, this is much better than the codestories... People crave short dopamine nowadays, and codestories are just very hard! It just makes sense to build a shorts content generation (and publishing) engine. And I'm finally ready for it!

LET'S GO ALL IN
-->

# Parsing

- ✅ Find all views in a section
- ✅ Find all audios in a section
- ✅ Parser: `string` to `MarkdownParse` to `ShortMarkdown`
- ❌ If needed: `ShortMarkdown` to `MarkdownParse` to `string`

# UI

- ✅ Show menu with all files in `short-markdown/docs`
- ✅ On any markdown page, `FileWriter`
- ✅ add tabs
- ✅ In "shortMarkdownStudio" tab, open the Parse content to a `ShortMarkdown`
  - ✅ render a header
  - ✅ render a background image

# Content

✅ Finish the content by adding all screenshots and videos using the "Edit" tab, and adding some spoken text to it (alt with quotes)

# More parsing

- ✅ Add keys to match audio
- ✅ Parse spokenText from alts with quotes
- ✅ Ensure the audios are not matched on things that have a spokenText alt
- ✅ Parse text to sentences and one mp3 per sentence and get duration of every mp3

# Audio in UI

- ✅ Ensure audio can actually be played by making `[file].[anything].mp3` always be allowed from the api.
- ✅ Create `useEffect` for changing slide
- ✅ Go to next slide after the durationMs milliseconds
- ✅ Implement a component that preloads all audios for the `ShortMarkdown` and lets you play one with a callback (look at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47686345/playing-sound-in-react-js)
- ✅ If slide has audio belonging to it, find it and play it. Start at certain point, depending on which part you are at.
- ✅ Select the correct audio for every slide, and get the API url for it. Load it in into an `<audio>` element once you go to the slide.

# UI

- ✅ Render image and video with covering the whole square (absolute, behind title)
- ✅ If available, render the title in the middle
- ✅ Fix the problem where the scroller only scrolls if it doesn't fit on the screen or basically if there's a menu... >.<
