# Creating our own "Marvel Franchise"

AI movie production is going to be easier and easier. But let's start with comics. They can easily be created with GPT4 + Stable Diffusion!

What if I would create a good plotline and unlimited potential for further stories, like Marvel does?

TODO:

- Try character development with ChatGPT and come up with some interesting characters: Lucky Coder, Cloud, Wiz, Rainman, Guill, PoenCa$h
- Come up with a common enemy: Evil Corp (or so)
- Which other components are required to create a good series?
- what is a recipe for a marvel movie? what do they have in common?
- If I can create a very well designed cartoonish representation of each character, it should also be possible to somehow embed them into created cartoons
- Once all components are there, GPT4 can come up with a plot for a cartoon, and a visualisation for every cartoon
- All cartoon pics can be stringed together with subtitles and voice over in order to get a video, which should be watchable.

This would be a good starting point! Once I have something like this, it can slowly be developed further into a real movie franchise. It can then sort of integrate with our HR / Recruitment and create a movement out of it with passionate AI devs saving the world...
