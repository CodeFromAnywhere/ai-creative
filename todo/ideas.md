# Improvements UI

- Look for a good design for the non-image slides (gradient, font styling, etc). Can use third-party library for this
- Programmatically go to the next slide if autoplay
- Play backgroundMusic in other track, playing audios with smooth layover on a different volume. When manually going to another slide, skip to the right place in backgroundMusic
- Use some frontmatter to decide on nice backgroundMusic
- Play sound effects on title slides

# Watcher

The best thing would be to make it easy to immediately ask for an alt-text when you have a new recording or screenshot, and insert it into your file. Maybe the watcher can fire a notification that, if you click on it, lets you insert metadata about the new asset.

# Autorecording?

Once autoplay is done and once the videos seem to have a fair quality, autorecording could be super nice

If this is possible, we can basically generate an mp4 for any markdown file, especially if we make it work with more normal markdowns as well. This means we can create hundreds if not thousands of videos that we can auto-upload to youtube. This is a goldmine.

Not super important for now though

# Voice cloning

Voice clone of myself will make this perfect, not important though

# Image augmentation

It would be super useful to augment markdowns with images (and customise easily). This would enable it to create visual experiences from any text, which would make it much more consumable.

# CTA's, intro's, outro's

This will make it even better.
